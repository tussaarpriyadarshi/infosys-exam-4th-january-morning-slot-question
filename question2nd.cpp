// You are given an integer array A of size N.

// You are allowed to perform at most K swap operations.
// In one swap operation, you may choose any two indices i and j and swap A[i] and A[j].

// Note: Swapping the same pair of elements more than once has no effect (i.e., repeated swaps cancel out).

// After performing at most K swaps, find the maximum possible sum of a contiguous subarray.

// Return that maximum subarray sum.
